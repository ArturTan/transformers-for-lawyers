  This site is putting some idea in the move.
  <b> Lawyers needs AI search engines and BERT can be a good start to
    test state of art of machine learning in finding proper information. </b> <br>
    For now, you can check a transformer model for Polish tax law ("PolTaxRoBERTa"), trained from scratch on the given documents
<br>
  I am aiming to test other approaches (like other transformer architectures),
  and fine-tune it, in order to prepare an ultimate benchmark of AI solutions
  for legaltech, so stay tuned and follow me at
